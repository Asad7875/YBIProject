# YBIProject
Ybi Foundation Internship project(Car-Price Prediction)
--This is code for a Machine learning model that incorporates the concept of Linear Regression.

--Here, two entities are involved, X- Independent variable and Y- Dependent variable.

--Y is the Selling Price here, which we want to predict, and X define all the other attributes that are present in the data set which is imported at the start of the code.

--We then split the data from data set into training set and testing set.The model is trained on the training set where it learns about the hidden patterns or insights in the dataset given, and using the testing dataset, we test the model's learnt knowledge about the given data.

--The split data set is aslo fitted into the model using '.fit()' and then value of y can be predicted.

--Also, we make use of the 'matplotlib' library in python and import 'pyplot' module from it for creating a visual representation of the actual values in dataset and the predicted values by the model using the 'scatter' function.
